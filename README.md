## Front-end test

Hello. This is a test front-end project. Was implemented form with three routes and validate each of them.

Based on starter kit [davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)

### How to launch
 - clone repo from git/ download a zip and extract.
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`

Next step is go on `localhost:3000`.

Have fun :)
## Thank You
